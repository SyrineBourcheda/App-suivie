# Geolocation and child tracking application

This project consists in designing and developing a mobile application allowing parents to follow all their children's movements according to their schedules. Indeed, after specifying class schedules, activities, etc., parents will receive notifications in case their children go out of the authorized zone. The application allows parents to communicate with their children in case of overstepping the zone and to ask for an explanation.
